## Pattern Recognition

Pattern Recogntion is a machine learning process in which the computer is fed a large pool of data that they will attempt to find regularities in order to automatically recognise the content. This recognition can be applied to any form of media whether it be text, images, sounds and much more. It is also expected that the algorithm can "recognize and classify unfamiliar objects, recognize shapes and objects from different angles, and identify patterns and objects even if theyâ€™re partially obscured."[^arm24citation]

Scientific innovations such as prostehtic arms can use this technology to their advantage by applying Electromyographic (EMG) pattern recognition which is a recognition system "constructed for real-time control of a prosthetic arm through precise identification of motion and speed command" [^lee84controlcitation]. This method uses an accumulation of data such as distances recorded with the help aritificial intelligence and multiple reference paremeters.  [^park98emgcitation]

Other practical applications of pattern recognition can be found in every day life such as speech and fingerprint recognition used by your smartphone, image recognition that can define contrasts in a photo as well as more professional fields such as the medicine and economy which uses it for medical imaging and data analysis to predict the market fluctuations.
