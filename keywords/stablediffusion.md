## Stable Diffusion

Stable Diffusion is a deep learning model capable of converting text to image in a highly precise way by adding descriptive information about the desired output. The way the AI learns is by "destroy[ing] the image [provided to it] by adding noise, and [...] reverse this process and regenerate the image from scratch." [^stablediff24] The problem with this process is how it infringes on copyrights since it takes its pool of image from the internet, most often than not from sources that are not free of use. Other than for personal use, the professional use of this new technology is highly debated and those who use it to try and produce commercial art pieces and sell it as their own art can face legal consequences. However, one article "indicate[s] that text-to-Image AI has the potential to revolutionize the way art is taught, offering new, cost-effective possibilities for experimentation and expression." [^de23what] To elaborate, they believe that students could be assigned projects relating to relevant real-world topics and with the aid of stable diffusion, create an art piece that correlates to the subject at hand.

It is also still a rather new innovation, therefore it is denoted that "[o]ne significant challenge lies in the instability and inconsistency of the generated outputs." [^du24stable] This means that often times, even with a largely detailed textual description of the wanted output, it will take many trials and errors before getting the result that the user is precisely looking for. This could be due to the fact that the machine doesn't have an infinite reserve of material it can train on, meaning it is bound to have some words that don't have many original images to reference from.
